This is a Python script that monitors the presence of devices on a local network based on their MAC Addresses.
The Adress Resolution Protocol is used to get the MAC Addresses of all devices on the local network.

The "devices" file is used to create a mapping between the MAC Address of a known device and its owner Name.
MAPPING: MAC_address-IP_address f.e.: 18:f0:e4:d2:0b:d7-Philipp
